### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

About me:
I am a professional with more than 15 years of experience in the IT recruitment sector, specialised in the selection and validation of technical profiles. 
I have worked with different clients and projects, negotiating rates as well as working conditions. 
I am passionate about new technologies and data analysis, so I have decided to train in Data Science with Python.
My goal is to turn my professional career around and be able to apply my knowledge and skills in this emerging field and add value to organisations.
